# Raspberry Pi Swap Configuration File
#
# This file configures Raspberry Pi swap management.
#
# Default values are provided as commented-out options.
# Uncomment and modify any settings you wish to change.

# Changes to this file take effect at boot time.
#

[RpiSwap]
# Controls which swap mechanism to use.
# Possible values:
#Mechanism=auto      # Automatically select best mechanism (default)
#Mechanism=swapfile  # Traditional swap file on disk
#Mechanism=zram      # RAM-based compressed swap
#Mechanism=zram+file # RAM-based compressed swap with backing file on disk
                     # (Uses the file specified in Swapfile::Path
                     #  as backing store via a loop device)

# Note: For mechanisms that don't involve a file (e.g. "zram"),
# all [Swapfile] settings are disregarded, and any existing
# swap file will be removed to free up disk space.

[Swapfile]
# Path to the swap file. Used directly by swapfile mechanism,
# and as backing store via loop device for zram+file mechanism.
#Path=/var/swap

#
# Swap size calculation parameters
# The final size will be the minimum of these constraints.
#

# Target swap size as factor of system memory
# Example: "1" means 1x the system RAM
#SwapFactor=1

# Maximum swap size in MiB
# Set to limit the maximum swap regardless of RAM size
# Set to "" (empty string) to disable this limit altogether
#MaxSwap=2048

# Maximum percentage of available disk space to use for swap
# Set to prevent swap from consuming too much disk space
#MaxDiskPct=50

# Explicit swap size in MiB
# If set, this overrides SwapFactor calculation
# Uncomment and set to specify an exact size
#SwapSize=512
