.SH NAME
rpi-swap-generator \- systemd generator for Raspberry Pi swap management

.SH SYNOPSIS
/lib/systemd/system-generators/rpi-swap-generator

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBrpi-swap-generator\fR is a systemd generator that automatically configures swap during early boot based on system requirements and user preferences. It is part of the rpi-swap package designed specifically for Raspberry Pi systems.

The generator dynamically creates systemd units to implement various swap mechanisms, including traditional swap files, compressed RAM-based swap (zram), and hybrid approaches. A key feature is its ability to resize swap files during early boot, which is crucial for memory-constrained systems where performing swapoff/resize/swapon operations later might not be possible or desirable.

.SH KEY FEATURES
.TP
\fBDynamic swap sizing\fR
Automatically calculates appropriate swap sizes based on available memory and storage.

.TP
\fBEarly boot resize\fR
Resizes swap files during early boot before they are activated, avoiding memory pressure during resize operations.

.TP
\fBMultiple swap mechanisms\fR
Supports traditional swap files, zram compression, and hybrid zram+file approaches.

.TP
\fBAutomatic writeback\fR
For hybrid configurations, implements intelligent writeback of less active pages from compressed memory to storage.

.SH CONFIGURATION
Configuration is handled through \fBswap.conf\fR(5). The generator reads this configuration and creates the appropriate systemd units automatically.

.SH FILES
.TP
\fI/etc/rpi/swap.conf\fR
Main configuration file.

.TP
\fI/lib/systemd/system-generators/rpi-swap-generator\fR
The generator script itself.

.SH SEE ALSO
\fBswap.conf\fR(5), \fBsystemd.generator\fR(7), \fBsystemd.swap\fR(5)

.SH NOTES
This generator is invoked automatically by systemd during boot. Manual invocation is generally not necessary unless testing configuration changes.
